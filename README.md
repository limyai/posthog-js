# Posthog JS

This is our fork from the official posthog-js [https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js ]

## Documentation

We have set up a custom capability of supporting custom attribtues via the css_selector_allowlist,
using a new property called css_selector_allowlist_extra_properties in the autocapture config.
in the following branch: limy-custom-autocapture

every once in a while, its best to backmerge from the main repo into our custom code.

## Packages
For more detauils see the official posthog-js repo
